# DQC Tech Challenge

Thank you for participating!
We appreciate the time you put into our conversations and this excercise.

There are 2 challenges which you will find under `/backend` and `/frontend` folders. You will find detailed explanations of what is expected in each challenge in their respective README's.

For pure frontend or backend applicants we expect a single solution. For Fullstack developers please attempt both challenges, however we expect a less polished solution than devs doing only one or the other.

## How to approach the task:

- There is no "right" or "wrong" way of doing this! We are not looking for a perfect solution.
- We would like to see how someone approaches the problem (e.g., use comments, and git commit messages)
- We also would like to see what's important to you (e.g., if you want to write a test, feel free to do it)
- Please timebox the excercise, we know you have a lot to do on the side and this should be no big stress factor
- Once you're done, please send a zipped git-folder back, or just commit it to Github/Gitlab/... and send us the link
